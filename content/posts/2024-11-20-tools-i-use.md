People sometimes ask what tools I use. Here's the current setup:

## Editor
Neovim. I switched from VS Code a couple years ago and haven't looked back. The modal editing finally clicked.

## Terminal
Ghostty + zsh. Fast and stays out of the way.

## Languages
Mostly Python and TypeScript these days. Rust when I need performance.

## Notes
Plain markdown files in a folder. Synced with git. No fancy app needed.

The common thread: simple tools that do one thing well. I'd rather learn a tool deeply than switch to the new hotness every year.
